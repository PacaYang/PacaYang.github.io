<div style="text-align: left;"><img style="margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px; float: left;" alt="DIY Cat Toys &amp; Local Resources for Indoor Fun in Minneapolis" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0814/8369/4394/files/Email_body_desktop_1200x1000_5_480x480.png?v=1755538416"></div>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>DIY Cat Toys from Local Materials</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Crafting your own cat toys is a fun and cost-effective way to provide entertainment for your pet. Here are some simple ideas using materials you can find locally:</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
<span>1. </span><a href="https://www.inforum.com/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment/pet-toy-diy-easy-handmade-toys-are-safe-fun-for-cats-and-dogs-alike"><span>Fleece Wand Toy: </span></a>
</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Cut two strips of fleece into 3-inch by 9-inch pieces. Tie them together in the middle, then cut each strip into smaller strips from the end to the knot. Thread a small bell through one strip and secure it with a knot. This creates a crinkly, enticing toy that your cat can bat around. </span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
<span>2. </span><a href="https://www.inforum.com/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment/pet-toy-diy-easy-handmade-toys-are-safe-fun-for-cats-and-dogs-alike"><span>Braided Fleece Tug Toy: </span></a>
</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stack three strips of fleece (each 4 inches by 21 inches) and tie a knot at one end. Braid the strips tightly, leaving enough room at the end to tie another knot. This sturdy toy is perfect for interactive play and can also serve as a tug-of-war tool. </span></p>

</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Take a clean, empty plastic bottle and cut small holes all over the bottle. Place kibble or treats inside the bottle and watch your cat nudge it around to get the treats out. This stimulates your cat's mind and encourages physical activity. </span><b></b><span></span></p>
